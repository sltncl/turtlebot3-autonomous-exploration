### `ros_ws/src` contains:

#### `turtlebot3_gazebo`
- Forked and adapted from [ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations).
- Includes robot models and launch files to spawn TurtleBot3 in a Gazebo simulation and establish communication with ROS.

**Modifications:**
- In the `params/` folder, portions of code in `turtlebot3_burger_bridge.yaml` related to TF bridging between Gazebo and ROS have been commented out, as this functionality is now handled by `robot_localization`.
- Added a custom simulation world `custom_house.world` in the `worlds/` directory.
- Modified launch files:
  - `turtlebot3_world.launch.py`: Commented out Gazebo client to reduce simulation load (runs only server).
  - `turtlebot3_dqn_stage4.launch.py`: Same optimization.
  - New launch file: `turtlebot3_custom_house.launch.py`.
  
These launch files are essential to spawn the robot in different simulation environments.

#### `turtlebot3_autonomous_exploration`
Main custom package developed for this project.

## 🚀 How to Run the Simulation

### 1. **Build the Docker Image**

```bash
cd docker_ws
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```

> Ensure scripts are executable:
```bash
cd ..
chmod +x run.sh exec.sh chown_me.sh
```

### 2. **Run the Docker Container**

```bash
./run.sh
```

### 3. **Inside the Container**

Run the following commands:

```bash
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
cd /root/ros_ws
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch turtlebot3_autonomous_exploration main.launch.py
```

RViz2 should start and show the simulation in real time.

## 🌍 Switching Simulation Environments

To change the simulated world:

1. Go to:
   ```
   ros_ws/src/turtlebot3_autonomous_exploration/launch/main.launch.py
   ```
2. On **line 12**, update the launch file name to one of the following:

   - `turtlebot3_world.launch.py`
   - `turtlebot3_dqn_stage4.launch.py`
   - `turtlebot3_custom_house.launch.py` *(default)*
